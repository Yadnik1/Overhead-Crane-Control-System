# Overhead-Crane-Control-System
 A highly efficient and reliable embedded system firmware for overhead crane applications. Developed using STM32G030C8T6 MCU, this project presents a specialized solution for encoder and decoder units, tailored to enhance the performance and safety of crane operations. The firmware in the project can be broken down into 3 essential parts i.e the encoder unit (remote), decoder unit (control system on the crane) and the EEPROM configuration firmware.
