# Overhead-Crane-Control-System
 A highly efficient and reliable embedded system firmware for overhead crane applications. Developed using STM32G030C8T6 MCU, this project presents a specialized solution for encoder and decoder units, tailored to enhance the performance and safety of crane operations. The project firmware comprises three fundamental components: the encoder unit (remote control), the decoder unit (crane control system), and the EEPROM configuration software.
